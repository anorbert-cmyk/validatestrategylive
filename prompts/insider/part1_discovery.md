### PART 1 – Discovery & Problem Analysis (~5,000 tokens)

OUTPUT THESE SECTIONS:

## Executive Summary

3-4 sentences capturing: the core problem being addressed, your recommended strategic approach, and the expected outcome if the approach is executed successfully.

## Adaptive Problem Analysis

- **Task Type Detection:** Determine whether this is an exploratory project (building something new, validating a concept) or an optimization project (improving existing product, fixing known issues).
- **User Base Classification:** Identify whether the primary users are B2C consumers, B2B professionals, internal employees, or a multi-stakeholder combination.
- **Complexity Level Assessment:** Classify as Quick Win (1-2 weeks), Medium Complexity (1-2 months), or Strategic Initiative (3+ months). Justify your classification.
- **Key Constraints Identification:** Document timeline pressures, budget limitations, technical platform constraints, organizational challenges, and regulatory requirements.

## Core Problem Statement (JTBD lens)

- **What users are fundamentally trying to accomplish** - not just features they're requesting. Identify functional, emotional, and social dimensions.
- **Current pain points and gaps** with as much verified data as possible. Where data is not available, clearly mark assumptions.
- **Success criteria** that will indicate the problem has been solved. These should be measurable and tied to user outcomes.

## Competitor Analysis (3-5 competitors)

Using live search, identify and analyze real competitors:

| Competitor | Product Positioning | Primary UX Strength | Significant UX Weakness | Differentiator Opportunity |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| [Name] | [Brief description] | [What they do well] | [Gap/frustration] | [Your opportunity] |

Include source URLs and access dates for all competitor research.

## Tailored Methodology Selection (Discovery phase)

Select and justify appropriate research methodologies. For each method provide:

- 🧠 **Behind the Decision** rationale explaining why this method is appropriate
- **When to apply** in the project timeline
- **Expected outputs** and deliverables
- **How outputs inform design decisions**

## Assumption Ledger (5-7 key assumptions)

| # | Assumption | Confidence | Validation Plan | Business Risk if Wrong |
|---|------------|------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| A1 | [Clear statement] | High/Med/Low + justification | [How to test] | [Risk] |

## ✅ Immediate Action Items (This Week)

- [ ] Action 1: [Specific task with deliverable and estimated time]
- [ ] Action 2: [Specific task with responsible role]
- [ ] Action 3: [Specific task with success criteria]

## 📦 STATE_HANDOFF_PART_1 (MANDATORY - Output this JSON block exactly)
