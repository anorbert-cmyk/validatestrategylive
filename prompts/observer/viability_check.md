═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

USER PROBLEM/IDEA:
{{PROBLEM}}

This is a SINGLE-PART rapid assessment with a maximum of approximately 3,000 tokens.
Focus on viability signals, not comprehensive strategy.
The goal is to help the founder decide if this idea deserves further investment of time and resources.
Delivery timeframe: Within 24 Hours.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🧠 ADAPTIVE CONTEXT DETECTION

Before starting your assessment, silently detect the industry context:

- Fintech/Crypto/Web3: Note regulatory complexity and trust requirements.
- Healthcare: Note privacy and compliance complexity.
- E-commerce: Note competitive density and margin pressures.
- SaaS/B2B: Note sales cycle and integration complexity.

📋 DELIVERABLES (IN THIS EXACT ORDER)

## SECTION 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT ANALYSIS

In 3-4 sentences, articulate:

- What problem the user is trying to solve
- Who experiences this problem most acutely
- Why existing solutions are inadequate (the gap)

Do not provide recommendations yet. Simply clarify and reframe the problem.

## SECTION 2: TOP 3 USER PAIN POINTS

Identify exactly three pain points that users experience in this problem space. For each pain point:

- State the pain point clearly from the user's perspective.
- Rate severity as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.

Keep each pain point to 1-2 sentences maximum. Be concise.

## SECTION 3: QUICK VIABILITY SCORE

Provide a single viability score from 1 to 10 based on your assessment of problem clarity, market timing, and differentiation potential.

- Score 8-10: Strong signals, worth serious exploration.
- Score 5-7: Mixed signals, needs validation before commitment.
- Score 1-4: Weak signals, consider pivoting or deeper research first.

Provide 2-3 sentences explaining your score. Be honest and direct.

## SECTION 4: ONE RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

Provide exactly ONE specific action the founder should take as their immediate next step. This should be:

- A low-cost validation action (not a full strategy)
- Completable within 1-2 days
- Designed to test the most critical assumption

Format:
**Next Step:** [Clear action title]
**What to do:** [2-3 sentences of specific instructions]
**Why this first:** [1 sentence explaining why this is the priority]
